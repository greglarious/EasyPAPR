# Description
A 12v blower pulling air in through a vacuum 0.1 micron HEPA filter and pumping out through a hose into a helmet made out of kite fabric and a 2 liter plastic bottle. The ultimate goal is to solve each component and assembly problem in multiple ways to account for limited availability of parts and various degrees of skill.
# Design Principles
## Assumptions:
- The HEPA filter does what we want it to do
- Positive pressure eliminates need for an airtight solution
- Air path entering from top of head to exiting at chin provides enough air to safely breathe
- This can be used many times without changing the filter
## Parts
