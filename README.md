# Description
A 12v blower pulling air in through a vacuum 0.1 micron HEPA filter and pumping out through a hose into a helmet made out of kite fabric and a 2 liter plastic bottle.
# Design Principles
## Assumptions:
- The HEPA filter does what we want it to do
- Positive pressure eliminates need for an airtight solution
- Air path entering from top of head to exiting at chin provides enough air to safely breathe
- This can be used many times without changing the filter
## Parts
- Hoover 3100 replacement HEPA filter
- 12v squirrel cage blower fan
- small 12v battery
- inline 3A automotive fuse and holder
- Dishwasher drain hose
- Airtight nylon kite fabric
- 2 liter beverage bottle
- Aluminum strips (Aluminum Roll Valley Flashing)
- machine screws/nuts
- needle and thread
- elastic
# Assembly
Stay tuned for instructions, pictures, videos etc
# Testing
Stay tuned for testing parts / technique / results with a PM2.5 dust sensor
