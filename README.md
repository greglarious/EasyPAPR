# Description
A 12v blower pulling air in through a vacuum 0.1 micron HEPA filter and pumping out through a hose into a helmet made out of kite fabric and a 2 liter plastic bottle. The ultimate goal is to solve each component and assembly problem in multiple ways to account for limited availability of parts and various degrees of skill.
# Design Principles
## Assumptions:
- STOP, HEPA filters can be dangerous. Need to find a safe HEPA filter without glass fibers ...
- Positive pressure eliminates need for an airtight solution
- Air path entering from top of head to exiting at chin provides enough air to safely breathe
- This can be used many times without changing the filter

## Goals:
- No tape/glue, fully disasseblable for cleaning purposes
- Propose multiple parts / techniques for every step to ensure more people can do this
- Durable
- Comfortable

## ToDo:
- 265nm UV LEDs shining on both inside and outside of HEPA filter material
- Case with belt to enclose both battery and filter. Allow air in but keep UV light from escaping
- Speed controller for motor
- Reshape hood to leave ears exposed
- Nose scratcher?
- Drinking tube?
- Red Propeller on top and small vent to make it spin!

| Faceplate cut from clear plastic. Source is 2 liter beverage bottle or large pretzel container | |
| inline 3A automotive fuse and holder | |
| Dishwasher drain hose | |
| Airtight nylon kite fabric | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/helmet_pattern.jpg" width=200> |
| 2 liter beverage bottle | |
| Aluminum strips (Aluminum Roll Valley Flashing) | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/clamp.jpg" width=200> |
| machine screws/nuts |  |

# Assembly 
## Clamping faceplate to fabric
Faceplate is a piece of clear plastic from a beverage bottle. Step here is to clamp it onto the fabric with some bent pieces of aluminum and machine screw/nut.
| Step | Image |
|------|-------|
| Drilling hole through faceplate | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/helmet_drill_clamp.jpg" width=250> |
| Screwing clamp into place | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/helmet_clamps.jpg" width=250> |
| Attached faceplate | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/helmet_faceplate_attached.jpg" width=250> |

## Attaching blower to filter with gasket
Blower has a circular air-input and the filter has an oval exit. Need adapter gasket to fit the two together in an airtight way.

| Gasket between filter and blower | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/blower_attached_to_hose.jpg" width=250> |

## Helmet Construction
Lightweight helmet to offer protection. No need to be airtight due to positive pressure design.
| Step  | Image |
|-------|-------|
| Sewing top of helmet | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/helmet_sewing_top.jpg" width=250> |
| Air exit holes (melted) | <img src="https://github.com/greglarious/EasyPAPR/blob/master/pictures/helmet_air_exit.jpg" width=250> |

## Headstrap for stabilization and directing airflow 
Headstrap stabilizes helmet position, attaches to air hose at back, and directs airflow to exit at the top sides of the head pointing down.
| Step | Image |
|------|-------|
| Basic comfortable headstrap design |  |
| Attachment for air hose at back |  |
| Split airflow 2 or 3 ways |  |
| Direction tubes leading to top/front sides |  |

# Testing Methodology
- Measure particle reduction effectiveness with with a PM2.5 dust sensor
- Use various harmless substances with a human detectable odor that fit a particle fitler test
- Battery life / burn in test
- Durability test
